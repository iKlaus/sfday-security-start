Symfony Day Cologne 2011 Security Workshop
==========================================

This repository is the starting point for this year's security workshop.

This project is simple, it's nothing more than a Symfony Standard Distribution
with the following changes:

* Removed the demo code
* DoctrineFixturesBundle has been installed
* StofDoctrineExtensionBundle has been installed
* A MainBundle has been created with the following with some nice CSS and a simple homepage
* Updated the base.html.twig template with some default layout
* A stubs directory contains some files that we'll need later
